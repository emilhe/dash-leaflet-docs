The `MarkerClusterGroup` component performs dynamic grouping of markers. When a large amount of markers are present, the clustering simplifies the visualization and makes it coherent across zoom levels. See the [documentation for the underlying component](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) for details. The component works well up to around 1000 markers, at which point performance starts to suffer due to limitations in the React bindings. If you have more than this, consider using the `SuperCluster` component instead.
