The `PolylineDecorator` draws decorations (dashes, arrows or custom icons) based on
 a list of coordinates passed via the `positions` property or a `Polyline` or `Polygon` component passed via the `children` property. The main use cases are illustrated in the example(s) below. For additional details, see the [documentation for the underlying component](https://github.com/bbecquet/Leaflet.PolylineDecorator).
