The `LocateControl` component enables geolocation. It is trigger on load if the `startDirectly` property is set to true, and each time the user clicks the locate icon. A wide range of customization options are available via the `options` property, see the [documentation for the underlying component](https://github.com/domoritz/leaflet-locatecontrol/blob/gh-pages/src/L.Control.Locate.js#L146) for details. In this example, the options are modified to enable [high accuracy location data](https://w3c.github.io/geolocation-api/#high-accuracy).
