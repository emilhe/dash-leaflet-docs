This example demonstrates usage of the `CirleMarker`, the `Polyline` and the `Polygon` components along with map and marker click events. On map click (exposed via the `click_lat_lng` property of the map), a `CirleMarker` is added. On subsequent clicks, new markers are added along with a `Polyline` that connects the dots. Finally, when a marker is clicked (exposed via the `n_clicks` property of the marker), the dots/lines are replaced by a `Polygon`.
