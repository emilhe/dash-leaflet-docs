The `SuperCluster` component is a high performance alternative to the `MarkerClusterGroup` component powered by [supercluster](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster). It does not (yet) support as many features as the `MarkerClusterGroup` component, but performance is **much** better. If you have more than 1000 markers, use this component.

Data can be passed directly via the `data` property or as an url to a resource via the `url` property. Per default, raw geojson is expected, but other formats can be used by changing the `format` property. For the best performance, use the `geobuf` format and pass the data via the `url` property. The example below is inspired by the [realworld 50.000 example](https://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.markercluster/example/marker-clustering-realworld.50000.html).
