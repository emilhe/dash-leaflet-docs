The `GeoJSON` component supports marker clustering via [supercluster](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster). It can be enabled by passing `cluster=True` to the constructor. Other options include `zoomToBoundsOnClick` (zoom to cluster on click) and `spiderfyOnMaxZoom` (draw markers in a spider formation if they can't be resolved at max zoom). Options to supercluster can be passed via the `superClusterOptions` property. Finally, the cluster symbol can be modified via the `clusterToLayer` property.
