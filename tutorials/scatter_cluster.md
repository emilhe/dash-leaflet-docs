Just like the `pointToLayer` option controls point rendered, the `clusterToLayer` prop controls how clustered are rendered. In the example below, the scatter plot example is extended to perform clustering with a custom cluster rendering function that draws a colored circle (with the color based on the average value of the clustered points) with the number of clustered points printed in the center.
