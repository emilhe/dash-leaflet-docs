The `GeoJSON` component supports customization of how points are rendered via the `pointToLayer` option. In this example, a scatter plot is created by rendering the points as circle markers colored based on a feature value (population density). Note that since the colorscale is constructed using the `chroma` javascript library, it must be pass via the `external_scripts` keyword of the `Dash` object.
