The standard approach to achieve interactivity in Dash is to replace a component by a new a new component with modified properties. While this approach works for the `GeoJSON` component too, performance may be poor for large datasets. A more efficient way to achieve interactivity is to render the `GeoJSON` data conditionally based on the content of the `hideout` property. By doing so, interactivity can then be achieve by changing the `hideout` prop from Dash. Note that by default the `hideout` prop does nothing, its sole purpose is to act as a proxy for passing state from Dash to the `GeoJSON` component.

In the example below, the [filter example](#geojson_filter) is made interactive using this approach. Notice how fast the map reacts to the drop down selection changes. That's because everything happens clientside. This pattern can be applied to achieve performant interactivity in many other use cases too, e.g. changing the symbol of a marker or the color of a polygon.
