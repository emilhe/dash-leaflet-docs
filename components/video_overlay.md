## VideoOverlay

Example demonstrating the syntax of creating a `VideoOverlay` component. To ensure that the video is compatible across devices, multiple urls can be provided. In this example, a webm file is provided, e.g. for Chrome, along with a mp4 file, e.g. for iPhone. Note that the videos could also have been loaded from the assets folder, in which case the urls would be `"/assets/patricia_nasa.webm"` and `"/assets/patricia_nasa.mp4"`.
