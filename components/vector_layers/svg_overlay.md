## SVGOverlay

The `SVGOverlay` component makes it possible to draw SVG overlays on the map. Presently, SVG component are not bundled as part of `dash-leaflet`, so a 3rd party library is needed. I have been happy with [dash-svg](https://github.com/stevej2608/dash-svg), which is easily installed via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/dash-svg/).
