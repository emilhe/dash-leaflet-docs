## Popup

The `Popup` component makes it possible to show a popup at a certain position. It can also be used to associate a popup with a component by placing the popup as a child of that component. In the latter case, the popup will open on click.

.. dash-proxy:: components.popup

### Known issues

The `interactive` flag does not work.
