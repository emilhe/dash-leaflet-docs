## GeoJSON

TODO: Should tutorial be here?

The `GeoJSON` component enables visualization of geospatial data. The data can be passed directly via the `data` property, or more efficiently as a static asset via the `url` property. Properties of type `Function` can be passed by supplying the [full path to the function](/content/func_props). The use of functional properties makes the `GeoJSON` component both performant and extremely customizable. Their usage is exemplified in the [`GeoJSON` tutorial](/content/geojson_tutorial) section.
